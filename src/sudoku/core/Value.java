    Pros and Cons of Using Enums Instead of Integers

    Pros:
    -----
    - Type Safety:
      Enums restrict the possible values to a defined set (e.g., Value.ONE to Value.NINE).
      This prevents invalid or unintended numbers from being used.

    - Clearer Semantics:
      Code like Value.TWO is more meaningful and self-explanatory than using plain numbers like 2.

    - Extendability:
      Enums can contain methods, fields, and logic.
      For example, a method like getNumber() can convert an enum to its corresponding int.

    - Better Maintainability and Readability:
      When reading or debugging, enums make the code more expressive and easier to follow.

    Cons:
    -----
    - Slightly More Verbose:
      Requires more code and structure compared to simple int usage.

    - Minor Performance Overhead:
      Accessing enum values can be marginally slower than using raw integersâ€”
      although this is negligible in most real-world applications.

    - Conversion Overhead:
      Enums may need to be converted to and from int, especially when interacting with user input,
      files, databases, or other external data sources.
